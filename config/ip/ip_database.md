IP Database Explanation:
------------------------

`ip_database.dat` is a file that contains country information for ranges of IP addresses. We currently use an old database provided by MaxMind (https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geoip2/geolite2/). The file is accurate enough for our demographic purposes. The information is _not exact_ and will not provide accurate geolocation all of the time, so do not solely depend on it.
